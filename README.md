MSDS 6306 Jan-Apr 2018 - Case Study 01

## Communications
###   2018 02/26/18 To: TEAM: I completed and resized the ggplot graphs in the report and updated the code, Solution and RMD files accordingly. The plots could be further enhanced if desired, but they should work OK for our presentation. I have downloaded and checked the knitted document but it would be great for others to test out the code. I plan to work on my version of the write-up tomorrow.
### ~~2018-02/16 5:05pm EST (MJKelleher) - TO: TEAM :  I will be working on the project tonight at 10pm EST.  If you want to collaborate let me know and I will start my GTM.~~
